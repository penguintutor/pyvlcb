Incoming app messages go via the API
These can be forwarded directly from the API thread to the main thread
That is a one way message - so could be through fifo / pipeline

Outgoing app messages are passed to the API
They are stored locally so the API can retrieve, but they are not deleted
Most likely shared memory - with API read only.
Need index variables to track where data is held


To / from serial has full write access to all data
